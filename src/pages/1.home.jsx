            <p>Hi there !</p>
            <p>
              As part of my learning and development, I wanted to become more
              familiar each HTML elementâ€¦
            </p>
            <p>
              ... so I decided to try and create a site which included all of
              them !
            </p>
            <p>
              I've included&nbsp;
              <span>81%</span>&nbsp;of HTML tags in this site so far.
            </p>
            <p>
              HTML gives structure to webpages, but the correct use of&nbsp;
              <dfn>Semantic HTML</dfn> - the meaningful use of HTML tags - is
              essential for two reasons:
            </p>
            <br />
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Accessibility</strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Search Engine Optimisation</strong>.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </section>

          <section>
            {" "}
            <h2>Accessibility.</h2>
            <p>
              People who are visually impaired have the option of using&nbsp;
              <dfn>Screen Reader</dfn>&nbsp;software - to help make sense of
              websites and so improve accessibility to the web.
            </p>
            <p>
              Screen Readers are driven by HTML tags, which explain to the user
              everything that is happening on the page.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, if a site has been built badly in terms of Semantic HTML, it
              makes it far more challenging to navigate - causing additional and
              unnecessary barriers to accessibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's also important to note that Screen Readers can't read text
              displayed in the form of image files - so this should also be
              considered when developing new sites.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Search Engine Optimisation.</h2>
            <p>
              There are a number of ways to boost Search Engine rankings - known
              as <dfn>Search Engine Optimisation</dfn> (SEO) - but the first
              thing to get right is using Semantic HTML correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Search Engines use algorithms to scan websites for matches, and
              part of this is matching with sites built using the full range of
              HTML tags for the right jobs.
            </p>
            <p>
              So not only does Semantic HTML masssively help improve
              accessibility, it also means that people are more likely to
              discover a website in the first place - all the more reason to get
              it right.

              <p>
                In May 2021 I tore a tendon in my right hand, leading to chronic
                tendinitis.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unable to use a keyboard, I started to explore the possibility
                of learning to code by speech.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thankfully I discovered <dfn>'Talon Voice'</dfn>.
              </p>
              <p>
                'Talon Voice' is a piece of fully customisable open-source
                software.
              </p>
              <p>
                It allows the user to replace keyboard commands with voice
                commands.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the best results, 'Talon Voice' needs voice recognition
                software to work alongside it.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm currently using the <dfn>'Dragon Dictate'</dfn> voice
                engine.
              </p>
              <p>Around 90% of this project has been made using Talon.</p>
